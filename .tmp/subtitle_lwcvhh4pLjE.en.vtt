00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Riyad Almubarak Checker: Hussain Laghabi 

00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:15.079
 (Tech Milan): It was our first talk on Facebook, 

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:17.053
 Which lasted for three full days. 

00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:18.501
 (Laughter) 

00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:21.657
 We exchanged more than 3,000 messages between us, 

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.083
 Then I knew she would be my wife. 

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:29.054
 We have not waited for any predetermined time to woo each other; 

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:31.433
 We became clear to each other with the fragile facts in us: 

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:33.701
 I'm a transgender man, 

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:37.135
 Which means that the alphabet in my birth certificate must mean the word "fake," 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.339
 Instead of "female." 

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:39.698
 (Laughter) 

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.606
 Face the world as a woman 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.952
 It was very painful. 

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.067
 That reduced my self-confidence, 

00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:47.351
 And upset my balance, 

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.484
 It caused me pain with every step forward. 

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:52.112
 But today, I am a man down at my own will; 

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:53.658
 A man as I want to be. 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.826
 (Kim Catherine Milan): I am a normal gay sex. 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.618
 That means the sex that was destined to be my birth time 

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.914
 You are and still are a woman. 

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.875
 This doesn't make me natural or normal, 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.835
 It is a method among several ways to describe 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.530
 Our presence in this world. 

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:11.804
 The word abnormal is a cultural term, 

00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:13.025
 But in this case, 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.672
 Indicates that I am not bound by a particular gender 

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:17.401
 When it comes to choosing partners. 

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:19.456
 I was introduced in many different ways - 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.090
 Bisexual and lesbian sex - 

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.191
 But for me, 

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:27.064
 The anomaly includes all these classes for who I am and I loved. 

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:29.354
 I layers and not parts. 

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:31.169
 And for me, 

00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:32.526
 The fact of being gay 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.932
 It meant that I could trust his kindness to me from the start. 

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:37.594
 As an aberrant and another transgender, 

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:41.565
 We are often excluded from institutions and traditions. 

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:44.563
 We create spaces outside the custom 

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:46.699
 Including time norms. 

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:49.776
 And in those 3,000 messages we exchanged, 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.038
 We have destroyed time; 

00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:52.221
 We misrepresented it; 

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.007
 And we put it completely on the table. 

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.067
 (Laughter) 

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:56.853
 Without the slightest demonstration at all. 

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.132
 This meant that we could stick to each other 

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:01.753
 In a profoundly different way. 

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:06.384
 So we are often told about this "golden rule," 

00:02:06.408 --> 00:02:09.849
 That we should treat others the same way we like to be treated. 

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:11.229
 But the problem with that 

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:14.484
 It assumes that we are the measure of others, 

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:15.728
 That is not true. 

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:19.242
 We need to treat others the way they like to be treated, 

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.035
 Which means we have to ask. 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.722
 I couldn't assume that the kind of love Teck needed. 

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:25.708
 It was the same kind of love I needed. 

00:02:25.732 --> 00:02:29.900
 So I asked him about everything - about his fears, his sense of insecurity - 

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:31.320
 From there it was our beginning. 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.992
 (Tech) I didn't realize what kind of love I needed. 

00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:36.216
 I was just out of a long year of haze 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.362
 Where I was rejected and fully exhausted. 

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:40.631
 It happened that someone looked at me 

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:44.094
 He told me that I am unworthy of them because I am a transgender. 

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.416
 As well as the existence of a culture of non-love 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.572
 That we created around transgender people. 

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:51.548
 This is cause and justification and is often passed as law. 

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:54.587
 I was close to grasping that message, 

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:56.153
 I don't deserve. 

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:57.945
 But Kim said I'm the perfect man. 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.574
 With all the tragic mess you were on 

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:00.748
 (Laughter) 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.826
 (Kim) My leg was already perfect. 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.962
 (Laughter) 

00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:05.310
 In more ways than one. 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.066
 Both poets, writers and creators 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.571
 With a long history of community work behind us, 

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:13.393
 And huge dreams of establishing a family in front of us, 

00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:15.534
 We share a lot of things, 

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.402
 We were also incredibly different. 

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:19.998
 I was a travel-loving person all my life and a bit orphan, 

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:22.164
 While he came from a big family, 

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:24.025
 He certainly remained attached to it. 

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:27.104
 I often summarize the differences in our strengths 

00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:28.686
 By saying, "Keep me safe, 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.150
 I will keep you unruly. ” 

00:03:30.174 --> 00:03:31.615
 (Laughter) 

00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:38.472
 (Tech) We have marginalized identities, but we don't live a marginalized life. 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.324
 Being homosexual and transgender is about creating new ways of coexistence. 

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:44.517
 It's all about loving others as they are, 

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.393
 And not as they are supposed to be. 

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:48.394
 Kim is unapologetically feminine 

00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:51.236
 In a world that is often cruel and violent 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.543
 Towards women who feel very proud and free. 

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.188
 I did not enter this union 

00:03:55.212 --> 00:03:58.717
 Under the auspices they'll be helping me or my help, 

00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:00.483
 But it's quite complicated - 

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:01.522
 (Laughter) 

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.840
 (Kim) Right? Not so. 

00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:05.560
 (Tech) But a human being is quite complicated 

00:04:05.584 --> 00:04:09.193
 I have not been able to control, control or criticize her femininity. 

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:10.739
 It was her intelligence, 

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:12.407
 The pity that is obvious in her dealings, 

00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:14.576
 She never loses her sympathy. 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.669
 I have been my hero since the first day. 

00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:20.308
 (clap) 

00:04:21.445 --> 00:04:25.123
 (Kim) Our relationship has always been about freedom for both of us. 

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:26.980
 He was among the first questions I asked him 

00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:29.175
 About his remaining dreams to achieve, 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.259
 And how can I help him to achieve them. 

00:04:31.283 --> 00:04:33.227
 His dreams of living as a poet, 

00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.441
 To adopt and create a family together, 

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:37.181
 To live a life he is proud of, 

00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:40.488
 Life can live up to his mother's incredible legacy. 

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:44.417
 And I really estimated that we could start from that place, 

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.347
 It is not out of knowledge 

00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:49.516
 How do we adapt to each other. 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.113
 I think this has allowed us to grow up to what we have become 

00:04:53.137 --> 00:04:55.068
 In an incredibly different way. 

00:04:55.393 --> 00:04:57.178
 I love him so much; 

00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.625
 Before the transition, now and in the future. 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:02.441
 And this love is the reason for our commitment to each other 

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:05.173
 Even before we see each other. 

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:09.056
 (Tech) Mom's biggest concern was when she turned 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.089
 She will love me as I am. 

00:05:11.555 --> 00:05:17.551
 Being a transgender, I was prevented from falling in love or bonding 

00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:20.500
 Is it because I was born in the wrong body? 

00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:23.699
 But this is the kind of structure that needs to be rewritten 

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:25.375
 To allow love to enter. 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.292
 He didn't betray my body at all, 

00:05:27.316 --> 00:05:29.004
 My body was not wrong at all. 

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:32.326
 All because of this restrictive dual thinking about sex 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.164
 Who issued a fatwa not to exist. 

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:35.489
 But when we met, 

00:05:35.513 --> 00:05:37.966
 She loved me just the way I looked. 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.941
 She tracked her fingers with narcotic smallpox scars 

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.701
 Left over by surgery at the top. 

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:46.741
 The scars stretched from the middle of my chest to the outer trunk. 

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:49.515
 She said it was a reminder of my strength 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.220
 And everything I went through 

00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:53.022
 There is nothing to be ashamed. 

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:55.054
 So she was demanding to marry 

00:05:55.078 --> 00:05:57.004
 The strangest thing I could do. 

00:05:57.028 --> 00:05:58.454
 (Laughter) 

00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:02.587
 It faced more traditional paths 

00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:04.443
 Of love and emotional relationships, 

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:07.613
 Because God would not have blessed the union of people like us, 

00:06:07.637 --> 00:06:09.919
 The judiciary would not have recognized it. 

00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:13.868
 (Kim) On May 5, 2014, 

00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:16.973
 Just about three months after our online meeting, 

00:06:16.997 --> 00:06:21.577
 We got married at the doorstep of City Hall in Manhattan, 

00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:25.258
 He was more than beautiful. 

00:06:25.637 --> 00:06:28.924
 It's safe to say that we've redesigned some traditions, 

00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:31.762
 We also kept some old ones, 

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:33.897
 We created something that suits us. 

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:39.221
 The bouquet of flowers and my dress was full of wild flowers from Brooklyn. 

00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:43.354
 With a little lavender and sage added to keep us steady 

00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:45.085
 Because we were so nervous. 

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:48.639
 A therapeutic friend, a wonderful sister, arranged for us. 

00:06:48.663 --> 00:06:50.302
 I didn't ask for a diamond ring, 

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.794
 Because conflict and custom were nothing to me, 

00:06:52.818 --> 00:06:54.623
 So the dark violet was Khatami, 

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.291
 Like the color of my coronary chakra, 

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.455
 And put in place with the birthstone jewel. 

00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:00.921
 Strangeness is conducive to choices. 

00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:03.081
 I didn't have to choose his last name, 

00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:04.727
 It was no exception, 

00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:08.080
 I did it because I was my father's illegitimate child, 

00:07:08.104 --> 00:07:12.106
 Someone who has always been an apology, a secret and a fard. 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.183
 It was incredible freedom 

00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.996
 To choose the name of the man who chose me first. 

00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:19.969
 (clap) 

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:27.795
 (Tim) So some family members and some close friends told us, 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.017
 Many who were not certified while we were sworn in. 

00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:34.935
 Appropriately, we posted our entire wedding photos on Facebook, 

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:36.160
 Where we met - 

00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:37.909
 And Instagram, for sure. 

00:07:38.462 --> 00:07:39.994
 We noticed quickly 

00:07:40.018 --> 00:07:43.216
 That our association with each other was more than a union of two people, 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.222
 It was a possible model for millions of LGBTQ's gay community 

00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:48.575
 Who believed this lie 

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.528
 That family and marriage are something contradictory to their situation - 

00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:54.282
 For us who rarely see ourselves 

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:55.907
 In the image of love and happiness. 

00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:57.409
 (Kim) And it is, 

00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:00.155
 That we are literally marginalized because of our identities, 

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.514
 But that strengthens us to be who we are. 

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:05.769
 Strangeness is our primary key; 

00:08:05.793 --> 00:08:07.695
 Blackness is our charm. 

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:09.315
 Thanks to these things 

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:14.096
 In being able to be hopeful, open, receptive and transformative. 

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.319
 These are the things that supply us, 

00:08:16.343 --> 00:08:18.955
 It is an incredible source of our strength. 

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:21.247
 Our alienation is the source of that power. 

00:08:21.271 --> 00:08:24.381
 I think of the words of Ottawa poet Brandon Winte who said: 

00:08:24.874 --> 00:08:28.986
 “He is not gay as a gay; 

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.152
 Odd as unexpectedly liquid and infinite. 

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.518
 Odd as an invincible alien freedom. 

00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:39.809
 As odd as fearless of imagining what love might look like, 

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.111
 And pursue him. " 

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:44.213
 (Tim) We're part of a community of people. 

00:08:44.237 --> 00:08:45.409
 Yes, that's great isn't it? 

00:08:45.433 --> 00:08:47.011
 (Laughter) 

00:08:48.663 --> 00:08:52.453
 We are part of a community of people who live by themselves 

00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:54.492
 Within the gender spectrum, 

00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:57.020
 Despite the threat of violence, 

00:08:57.044 --> 00:09:00.077
 In spite of the current anxiety, there is always anxiety 

00:09:00.101 --> 00:09:02.369
 For people who live according to their own visions. 

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:06.368
 Globally, every 21 hours a transgender person is killed. 

00:09:06.973 --> 00:09:13.572
 America has beaten the number of transgender people killed this year 

00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:15.013
 More than a year ago. 

00:09:15.037 --> 00:09:19.102
 However, our stories are much more than this rigid division 

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:20.578
 For strength and flexibility. 

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.719
 We are expanding human complexity in these margins, 

00:09:24.743 --> 00:09:27.493
 We create freedom in these margins. 

00:09:28.108 --> 00:09:30.304
 (Kim) And we don't have any plans. 

00:09:30.328 --> 00:09:34.182
 We create a world that we have not seen literally before; 

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:37.827
 We organize families based on love, not blood ties, 

00:09:37.851 --> 00:09:41.803
 We also lead the compassion enjoyed by a few of us. 

00:09:42.313 --> 00:09:46.327
 Many of us didn't have love from their families - 

00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:49.170
 We were betrayed by people we trusted so much. 

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.841
 So what we do here is that we are completely creating new languages ​​of love. 

00:09:54.297 --> 00:09:58.694
 Those related to creating spaces for us to be our authentic selves 

00:09:58.718 --> 00:10:00.764
 And not to impose this standard 

00:10:00.788 --> 00:10:03.689
 For what masculinity or femininity should be. 

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:06.835
 (Tim) We're interested in love and inclusion 

00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:09.507
 As a tool for revolutionary change, right? 

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.574
 The idea is simply, 

00:10:11.598 --> 00:10:13.724
 If we drop all our preconceptions 

00:10:13.748 --> 00:10:15.808
 About what someone is supposed to be - 

00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:19.007
 For his body, sex and color - 

00:10:19.031 --> 00:10:22.787
 If we take serious steps to put aside these deeply rooted prejudices 

00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:25.403
 And created space for people to identify themselves, 

00:10:25.427 --> 00:10:26.755
 And accepting who they are, 

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:30.550
 Then surely we will create a better world than we found ourselves in. 

00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:32.192
 (clap) 

00:10:37.774 --> 00:10:39.776
 (Kim) We want to make our mark in history 

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.568
 To leave evidence that we were here. 

00:10:42.954 --> 00:10:45.952
 We open small windows that tell about our relationship 

00:10:45.976 --> 00:10:47.649
 For the benefit of our society to witness it, 

00:10:47.673 --> 00:10:50.700
 We do this because we want to map the future 

00:10:50.724 --> 00:10:52.706
 And not edifices for ourselves. 

00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:57.073
 Our experience does not invalidate the experiences of others, 

00:10:57.097 --> 00:11:00.677
 But it must and necessarily complicate this idea 

00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:03.381
 About what love and marriage are supposed to be. 

00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:06.487
 (Tim) Well, to talk, 

00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:07.951
 And inspiration, 

00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:09.707
 And the model of possibility that we have established, 

00:11:09.731 --> 00:11:11.456
 We were never close to perfection. 

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.757
 We had to hold a mirror for ourselves. 

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.955
 And I realized that I'm not always a good listener, 

00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:20.264
 And that my ego stands in the way of our progress as a couple. 

00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:23.656
 I also had to assess these entrenched ideas and nationality 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.981
 And that was in my mind about the value of women's experience in the world. 

00:11:27.005 --> 00:11:30.439
 I had to reassess what it means to be in a relationship with my wife. 

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.615
 (Kim) And I had to remind myself a lot of things too. 

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:36.623
 About what it means to be strict about issues, 

00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:38.399
 But soft with the person concerned. 

00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:41.855
 As we were writing this, we engaged in a big fight. 

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:44.056
 (Laughter) 

00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:47.544
 For several different reasons, 

00:11:47.568 --> 00:11:51.899
 But we based our content on our values ​​and experiences - 

00:11:51.923 --> 00:11:53.671
 We were really hurt, you know? 

00:11:53.695 --> 00:11:58.745
 Because what we do and how we love put us completely on the front line. 

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:02.748
 But nonetheless, the fight spread for two days - 

00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:04.061
 (Laughter) 

00:12:04.085 --> 00:12:06.904
 We could go back to each other, 

00:12:06.928 --> 00:12:11.081
 And commitment to each other and to our marriage. 

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.826
 This has really paid off in some of the most emotional parts 

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.764
 For what we shared with you here, today. 

00:12:16.264 --> 00:12:18.496
 (Tim) I had to put masculinity into question, 

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.300
 Which has not reached the limit yet. 

00:12:20.744 --> 00:12:22.533
 I had to put masculinity into question; 

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.450
 The poisoned privileges that accompany me as a man, don't represent me, 

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:29.790
 But I have to be responsible for what I see in everyday life. 

00:12:30.304 --> 00:12:33.671
 I allowed my wife to take care of all the emotional load 

00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:37.933
 About intruding and opening lines of communication while I shut up and run away. 

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.084
 (Laughter) 

00:12:39.108 --> 00:12:43.357
 I was stripped of emotional support instead of facing my weaknesses, 

00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:46.796
 Especially about the tragic abortion we experienced last year, 

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.183
 I feel so sorry. 

00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:51.190
 Sometimes as men, we take the easy way. 

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:56.017
 So as a transgender, my journey is a re-imagination of masculinity. 

00:12:56.658 --> 00:12:59.173
 About creating immeasurable manliness 

00:12:59.197 --> 00:13:02.741
 With the power it has, the benefits it has, 

00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:05.270
 Or any false control image that it can muster, 

00:13:05.294 --> 00:13:07.112
 But working alongside femininity, 

00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:08.806
 My soul is led by me. 

00:13:10.744 --> 00:13:11.895
 (Kim) All of you ... 

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:14.104
 (clap) 

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:19.731
 And I have created this space for my femininity to bloom. 

00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:22.960
 In a way I have never experienced before. 

00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:27.512
 He's never threatened my sex life, 

00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:30.699
 He also never watches what I wear or how I behave. 

00:13:31.516 --> 00:13:34.710
 I cook but do more hygiene than I do. 

00:13:34.734 --> 00:13:36.926
 And when we rush out of the house rushed 

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.452
 And we have a lot of connections, 

00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:40.069
 He handles everything, 

00:13:40.093 --> 00:13:42.280
 So I have time, to make my hair and put on my dress. 

00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:43.454
 (Laughter) 

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:46.550
 He understands that this is my shield, 

00:13:46.574 --> 00:13:51.083
 And never treat femininity as a trivial or superficial thing, 

00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:52.923
 And this, which is - 

00:13:52.947 --> 00:13:56.267
 It makes my experience with sex grow bigger by the day. 

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.143
 (Tim) I like to follow her in her clothes in the morning. 

00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:01.057
 Looking at her in the closet, 

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.966
 Looking for something comfortable, colorful and narrow 

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.422
 And safe - 

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:06.596
 (Laughter) 

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:09.707
 But watching them negotiate their decisions is challenging 

00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:13.219
 Looking for something that gives her a minimum of attention, 

00:14:13.243 --> 00:14:16.864
 But at the same time it is an expression of the vitality and excitement it represents. 

00:14:16.888 --> 00:14:19.626
 All I want to do is celebrate her beauty, 

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.547
 And all the things that make it beautiful, distinctive and free, 

00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:24.022
 Like her long acrylic nails, 

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:26.066
 And even her stubborn black feminist. 

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.756
 (clap) 

00:14:31.135 --> 00:14:32.786
 - (Kim): I love you. - (Teck) I love you. 

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:33.960
 (Laughter) 

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:36.852
 (Kim) There's a lot of gay and transgender people 

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.269
 Who preceded us, 

00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:40.988
 And who will not be able to hear their stories. 

00:14:41.367 --> 00:14:44.643
 We are constantly facing this re-history 

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:46.803
 We are clearly excluded. 

00:14:47.347 --> 00:14:50.192
 It is really hard not to see ourselves there. 

00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:54.190
 So for us, speaking out is about that representation. 

00:14:54.618 --> 00:14:56.937
 It's about having models of capability, 

00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:00.822
 And the hope that love is part of our legacy in this world as well. 

00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:03.618
 (Tim) The possibility we practice 

00:15:03.642 --> 00:15:06.489
 It's about reinventing time, love and institutions. 

00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:09.152
 We are working to create the future of pluralism. 

00:15:09.544 --> 00:15:12.619
 We are working to expand the spectrum of sex and sexuality, 

00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:14.532
 Imagining ourselves in existence, 

00:15:14.987 --> 00:15:18.591
 Imagine a world where sex is a self-imposed decision, not an imposed one, 

00:15:18.615 --> 00:15:21.532
 And where we are a variable color kaleidoscope of possibility 

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:25.935
 Without narrow constraints disguised in the form of science and justice. 

00:15:27.013 --> 00:15:28.735
 (clap) 

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.005
 (Kim) Without lying: 

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:35.085
 It's very, very difficult. 

00:15:35.463 --> 00:15:38.156
 It's hard to stand up to bigotry 

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.545
 With an open heart and a smile above my face. 

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:43.800
 It is very difficult to face the widespread injustice in the world, 

00:15:43.824 --> 00:15:47.854
 You still believe in the ability of people to make real change. 

00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:51.479
 This requires a great deal of faith and dedication. 

00:15:51.878 --> 00:15:53.164
 And more, 

00:15:53.188 --> 00:15:55.297
 Marriage is a difficult business. 

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:56.472
 (Laughter) 

00:15:56.496 --> 00:15:59.064
 Piles of dirty socks lying on the ground, 

00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:02.849
 Sports programs are much more boring than I expected - 

00:16:02.873 --> 00:16:04.128
 (Laughter) 

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.307
 And the battles that push me to shed tears 

00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:09.196
 When it seems we are not understanding. 

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.339
 But no day passed 

00:16:11.363 --> 00:16:14.596
 Without being grateful that I got married to this man; 

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.446
 Without being grateful for the possibility of changing minds, 

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.012
 And reward dialogues, 

00:16:20.036 --> 00:16:23.016
 And create a world in which love belongs to all of us. 

00:16:23.478 --> 00:16:24.935
 I think of our short name: 

00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:28.930
 LGBTQ2SIA 

00:16:30.965 --> 00:16:34.618
 Apparently, an endless evolution of self and society, 

00:16:34.642 --> 00:16:38.677
 But also this overwhelming desire to leave no one behind. 

00:16:39.345 --> 00:16:41.207
 We have learned how to love each other, 

00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:45.070
 We have committed to love each other along changes in sex 

00:16:45.094 --> 00:16:46.662
 And changes in spirit. 

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.762
 We also learned that this love is our chat rooms, 

00:16:49.786 --> 00:16:53.466
 In our clubs, bars and social centers. 

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.224
 We have learned how to love each other for a long time. 

00:16:56.752 --> 00:16:57.924
 (Tim &amp; Teck) Thank you. 

00:16:57.948 --> 00:17:01.048
 (clap)
